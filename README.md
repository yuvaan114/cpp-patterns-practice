  Description  : This C++ file contains solutions to a variety of pattern
                 printing problems. Each pattern demonstrates the use of nested
                 loops, conditionals, and character/number manipulation.
                 These examples serve as a fundamental exercise to strengthen
                 control flow understanding (loops and conditionals), and help
                 beginners master logic building in C++.
<br>


  Key Concepts :
                 - Nested loops
                 - ASCII character arithmetic
                 - Loop segmentation (spaces, symbols)
                 - Conditional printing
                 - Loop boundary control

  Usage        : Compile and run the file. Each pattern block can executed individually for testing.
